A 5 minute introduction and demo of the program can be viewed [here](www.youtube.com). For the best experience see the quick demo first.

In the upper left corner you can choose between English and Danish. The quality of the answers is sometimes a bit better in english. Mostly due to out of the box support for english being better."""

        """The main form of interaction is by writing questions/commands. Your can write 3 different forms of requests.

 1) Specific questions such as "how has the unemployment evolved".
 2) Updates or changes to an existing question such as "include both sexes".
 3) Exploratory requests about the tables or information available at Denmark Statistics. An example could be: "How could I go about looking into unemployment".

When asking a specific question then GPT will find an appropriate table and device the right query to send to Denmark Statistics API. GPT will then provide and overview of the table, plot the data and add the possibility to filter the data. In order to limit the demand on Denmark Statistics API then GPT will try to request aggregate numbers for the variables where a question does not imply that this variable is important. As an example the question "How has unemployment evolved" will typically specify to Denmarks Statistics API to get the aggregate number for Men and Women since the distinction sex is not important to the question. If your are interested in differences depending on sex then you can either ask the question "How has unemployment evolved over time and for different sexes" or simply ask GPT to update the existing request by writing "include both sexes".

For more control of, which tables GPT should use then ask a more exploratory question and then GPT will give you an overview of the different tables available in Denmark Statistics. You can then select specific tables or categories that you wanna limit your search to. Once you have clicked the button "Use selected tables" then all subsequent question will only consider the selected tables. That is until you click the button "removed table selection"."""

Everything about this demo can be made better, faster and cheaper. As should be expected of most side projects that can be done in the available sparetime during a week or two.
And remember this is the worst this technology will ever be. And we're only just getting started."""
